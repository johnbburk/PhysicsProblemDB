        <h1>Getting started with development on a Windows machine</h1>
        
<div>
<p>
GitHub has the following paradigm: suck files down to your local machine, tinker
with them, make sure they work (testing, in our case, php, mysql, other interestiing
stuff), and them pushing the changes back up to the GitHub web server for others
to repeat. This page walks you through:
<ul>
<li>Getting your windows machine to talk with the GitHub server</li>
<li>Getting php and mysql to work on your machine</li>
<li>Figuring out where all the stuff is saved.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Talking with Github</h2>
<div>
<p>
Don't be alarmed when you hear people talking about having to use the command
line when using git and github. That's not the case in windows. Instead, 
<a href="http://windows.github.com/">download GitHub for Windows</a> and you have 
a very nice window-y way of dealing with our repository. Once you've dowloaded
it, go to our repository and hit "clone in windows" and you'll be off
and running. Once you do, it'll look something like this:
</p>
<img src='githubwindows.png' />
<p>
What that'll do is put a local copy of our repository (ie, every file we've made)
onto your machine whereever you've told github for windows to put it. 
I've found that telling github for windows to use the htdocs folder in the XAMPP
file structure (see below) makes things easiest.
</p>
</div>
<h2>Getting PHP and MySQL to work</h2>
<div>
<p>
Windows machines don't normally work as web servers. Php (our language of choice)
only works on machines that act as web servers! So we've got to do something
about that. In comes <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a>.
</p>
<p>
XAMPP installs an apache web server on your machine, installs the most up-to-date
version of PHP on your machine, installs a working MySQL database on your machine,
and gives you all kinds of helpful tools like phpmyadmin which lets you deal
with your database.
</p>
<p>
When you install it, say yes to the appropriate things. At the end, run the
XAMPP control panel that looks like this:
</p>
<img src='xamppcontrolpanel.png' />
<p>
You have to start both apache and the mysql tools for our stuff to work.
</p>
<p>
Now you browse to urls like localhost/phpmyadmin to play with the tools they have.
All the functioning tools are in the htdocs folder which is what localhost/ maps
to. That's why putting your github repositories there will then have you look
at urls like this: localhost/GitHub/PhysicsProblemDB/laravel/public/ which will
show your our splash page with links to cool tools.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Playing around</h2>
<div>
<p>
Ok, now let's say you want to make your own page. The easiest way to do this
is make a file called "test.php" or something similar and put it under the 
laravel/application/controllers/ folder in our repository. In it, type something
like this:
</p>
<code>
&lt;?php
class Test_Controller Extends Base_Controller
{
	public function action_index()
	{
		echo "Hello world";
	}
}
</code>
<p>
Then, in the laravel/application/routes.php file, add this line:
</p>
<code>
Route::controller('test');
</code>
<p>
then navigate to localhost/GitHub/PhysicsProblemDB/laravel/public/test/ to see
your new creation.
</p>
<p>
We'll have lots of other tutorials to let you get further, and reading 
<a href="http://daylerees.com/category/laravel-tutorials/">these great Laravel 
tutorials</a> should help a lot. Have fun!
